# Pendulum-Simulated-Using-RK4

This program solves both the liner, or small angle approximated version of the simple pendulum equation and compares it to the non-linear 2nd order ODE used to simulate the pendulum. The ODE was solved using the Runge-Kutta method in python. Both simulations were plotted against eachother to display the differences of the two solutions, the error between the two can especially be shown with larger drop angles and increased simulation time.
